  *	Class:	   Moped     			<BR>
  *	Purpose:	   This class extends from vehicle class and uses
  *               its methods to gather informtion for Mopeds.
  *               The constructor uses a parameter to determine
  *               the prompt for the vehicle and calls the vehicle
  *               constructor along with the show menu method. It
  *               also has two getters and a string formater for
  *               a display of the gathered information.
